Not really sure what features this is going to have yet beyond a character sheet where you can view the stats of your characters and possibly estimates of next level, when they'll need food, or when their inventories will be full. I may also include some crafting calculators at some point.

If you have any suggestions feel free to write an email to Coombsboy11@gmail.com. Please include "Idleon Character Manager" in the subject line.
