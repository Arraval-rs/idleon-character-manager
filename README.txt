This is an app created to interface with the JSON generated by the Idleon API Downloader developed by Corbeno. The API can be found here: https://github.com/Corbeno/Idleon-Api-Downloader?fbclid=IwAR1jJomVoZXyHX1m0M1gBLpfI4p6IZDHc4Np9RGxtLtmQKDB4AUIcfyaOu8

Most images were taken from the Idleon Wiki (https://idleon.info/wiki/Main_Page) or from the Idleon Companion repository (https://github.com/Musimaniac/IdleonCompanion).

To use the app make sure you have have the JSON file in the same directory as the application and ensure that it's name is "idleon_data.json". I may simply add a button for selecting any json file in the future.

Not really sure what features this is going to have yet beyond a character sheet where you can view the stats of your characters and possibly estimates of next level, when they'll need food, or when their inventories will be full. I may also include some crafting calculators at some point.

If you have any suggestions feel free to write an email to Coombsboy11@gmail.com. Please include "Idleon Character Manager" in the subject line.
