This is an app created to interface with the JSON generated by the Idleon API Downloader developed by Corbeno. The API can be found here: https://github.com/Corbeno/Idleon-Api-Downloader?fbclid=IwAR1jJomVoZXyHX1m0M1gBLpfI4p6IZDHc4Np9RGxtLtmQKDB4AUIcfyaOu8

Most images were taken from the Idleon Wiki (https://idleon.info/wiki/Main_Page) or from the Idleon Companion repository (https://github.com/Musimaniac/IdleonCompanion).

To use the app you will need Python and PYSimpleGUI installed. You can download the latest version of Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/. Please see https://realpython.com/pysimplegui-python/#installing-pysimplegui for instructions to install PySimpleGUI. You can overwrite the data in data/idleon_data.json with your own data from the Idleon API Downloader. I may simply add a button for selecting any json file in the future.

Not really sure what features this is going to have yet beyond a character sheet where you can view the stats of your characters and possibly estimates of next level, when they'll need food, or when their inventories will be full. I may also include some crafting calculators at some point.
